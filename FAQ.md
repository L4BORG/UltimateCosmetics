# Frequently asked questions

## I get an error upon startup!
Use the config files in the jar under the folder of the MC version you're running. For example, if you're running 1.8, use the config_1.8 files in the jar file.

## I want to run this plugin without Spigot!
Not possible, I depend on a lot of Spigot features, and you should use it if possible.

## Can you add feature X?
Open a new issue here: https://github.com/j0ach1mmall3/UltimateCosmetics/issues/new and I'll see what I can do about it.

## Can you help me with configuring this plugin?
If you paid for the plugin, you will receive free support.
If you didn't pay, you'll have to figure it out for yourself.
